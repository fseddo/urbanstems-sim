The Autumn Birthday Bundle brings the celebration with a warm, autumn-inspired bouquet and a box of eight legendary Levain Bakery cookies. With four classic flavors and that iconic crispy-gooey bite, these cookies are a party in every box. Paired with bright, seasonal florals, this gift set feels personal, elevated, and ready to make their day (and week). It’s gifting made easy and delicious.</span></p><p><strong>Allergens</strong>: Contains dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts)</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><em>Levain Bakery cookies are made by hand using shared equipment, which processes dairy, eggs, peanuts, soy, tree nuts and wheat. If you have a severe allergy, please know that while we do our best to prevent cross-contamination, we are not an allergen-free bakery.</em></p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><strong>Cookie Care:</strong></p><p>Cookies may be stored in an airtight container for up to one week or frozen if not enjoyed immediately. For maximum enjoyment, warm the cookie in a 350-degree oven for a few minutes or until gooey. Of course, if you simply can’t wait, then 20 seconds in the microwave should do it. If frozen, they’ll take roughly 5-10 minutes in the oven — but trust us, it’s worth it.</p><p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">To ensure everything arrives at its best, your flowers and cookies will be delivered in two separate packages, but both should land on your doorstep soon! Please note, your cookies will be arriving directly from Levain's bakery and so if your order is placed after 1 PM EST they will be shipped to you the following day and could arrive after your floral delivery. This product does not qualify for free shipping.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\">Lush and full of life, it's not every day that you'll come across these pillowy stems. This striking blush-toned bouquet is a welcome addition to any room. Peonies symbolize prosperity, making this a fitting gift for anything from congratulations to housewarmings. This peony arrangement may arrive in bud form but will unfurl into the pillowy stem we all love. <a href=\"https://urbanstems.com/blogs/news/peony-color-meaning?srsltid=AfmBOop77v2B1SU1nWqqliLqJb4a6-1OaSy-EqAw1WbIOLCsf8yZ4Cic\">Read more</a> about the meaning of the pale pink peony. Choose from three bouquet sizes of lush peonies, a 10-stem Single, a 20-stem Double, or a 30-stem Triple.<br><br><strong>Please note:</strong> Your peonies may arrive in bud form but will open in 1-2 days, meaning you can enjoy your blooms longer! Flower color may vary slightly from the pictured bouquet and gradually change as your flowers bloom.</span></p><p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\"><br>If your foliage looks slightly dehydrated upon arrival, place the stems in some water to revive them.

Always cut your flowers at an angle so they can absorb more water &amp; won’t suffocate on the bottom of the vase. After the initial cut, check the bottoms of your stems every couple of days, and if the ends are looking a bit slimy, just snip off an inch or so.</p><p><strong>3) Remove Leaves:</strong> Take off any excess leaves so that all the water is funneled into the petals. Pay special attention to leaves below the water line because they’ll decompose, causing rot and bacteria to grow, which will shorten the lifespan of your blooms.</p><p><strong>4) Remove Spent Blooms:</strong> Any flowers that are past their prime release ethylene gas which will age the flowers around them. Remove any flowers that are beginning to wilt to keep the rest of your bouquet fresh and happy.</p><p><strong>5) Keep Them Cool:</strong> Last but not least, keep your flowers in a cool area.

Always cut your flowers at an angle so they can absorb more water &amp; won’t suffocate on the bottom of the vase. After the initial cut, check the bottoms of your stems every couple of days, and if the ends are looking a bit slimy, just snip off an inch or so.</p><p><strong>3) Remove Leaves:</strong> Take off any excess leaves so that all the water is funneled into the petals. Pay special attention to leaves below the water line because they’ll decompose, causing rot and bacteria to grow, which will shorten the lifespan of your blooms.</p><p><strong>4) Remove Spent Blooms:</strong> Any flowers that are past their prime release ethylene gas which will age the flowers around them. Remove any flowers that are beginning to wilt to keep the rest of your bouquet fresh and happy.</p><p><strong>5) Keep Them Cool:</strong> Last but not least, keep your flowers in a cool area.

While that remains true, it’s also our double yellow orchid elegantly displayed in a sleek, black ceramic vessel. Excellent for adding a touch of autumnal luxury to any space, these stunning turmeric-shade orchids exude poise and appeal. Upgrade your space or a loved one’s this fall, everyone deserves this refined beauty.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light:</strong> Orchids prefer bright, indirect light. Place your orchid about 1 - 3 feet back from a South or West facing window to ensure the plant gets bright light but doesn’t get burned by the direct sun.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your orchid with 3 ounces or 2 ice cubes of water every week. In most cases, this will work. Occasionally, you’ll want to check the dryness of the potting medium (the moss the orchid is planted in). If it’s very dry, give the plant a more thorough watering.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> ALWAYS water below the leaves. If water flows into and sits and the center of the leaves, it will lead to crown rot and kill the orchid. If water does get between the leaves, soak it up with cotton buds or tissue. You can also blow gently into the meeting of the leaves to remove this water. Notes &amp; Tips: Keep me warm! Orchids are very sensitive to changes in temperature. If your orchid is exposed to cold (under 55 degrees) for more than 10 minutes, the unbloomed buds will begin to “blast” – turn yellow and shrivel up, and eventually fall off the plant. There’s no reversing this once it’s happened. Consider sending fresh flowers or another plant during the winter months. </p>",

Peace Lilies are very slow drinkers, and you’ll probably find that you’re watering your plant every 8 - 12 days, depending on the light and warmth in your home. Peace Lily leaves will begin to droop if the plant becomes very dry but will pop right back up after a drink. Don’t let this happen too often tho, as it stresses the plant.</p><p><strong>Notes &amp; Tips:</strong> The white “flowers” that we’re used to seeing on Peace Lilies aren’t flowers at all. They’re called a spadix, which is a structure that protects the actual flower – the prickly little thing inside the white spadix.</p><p><strong>Pet Safety:</strong> Philodendron and all aroid plants are not pet-safe. Place on a high table or shelf away from furry companions.</p>",

    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light:</strong> Orchids prefer bright, indirect light. Place your orchid about 1 - 3 feet back from a South or West facing window to ensure the plant gets bright light but doesn’t get burned by the direct sun.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your orchid with 3 ounces or 2 ice cubes of water every week. In most cases, this will work. Occasionally, you’ll want to check the dryness of the potting medium (the moss the orchid is planted in). If it’s very dry, give the plant a more thorough watering.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> ALWAYS water below the leaves. If water flows into and sits and the center of the leaves, it will lead to crown rot and kill the orchid. If water does get between the leaves, soak it up with cotton buds or tissue. You can also blow gently into the meeting of the leaves to remove this water. Notes &amp; Tips: Keep me warm! Orchids are very sensitive to changes in temperature. If your orchid is exposed to cold (under 55 degrees) for more than 10 minutes, the unbloomed buds will begin to “blast” – turn yellow and shrivel up, and eventually fall off the plant. There’s no reversing this once it’s happened. Consider sending fresh flowers or another plant during the winter months. </p>",

Our designer created this arrangement for those who appreciate beauty that feels both timeless and of-the-moment. Elegance, rooted in simplicity.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light:</strong> Orchids prefer bright, indirect light. Place your orchid about 1 - 3 feet back from a South or West facing window to ensure the plant gets bright light but doesn’t get burned by the direct sun.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your orchid with 3 ounces or 2 ice cubes of water every week. In most cases, this will work. Occasionally, you’ll want to check the dryness of the potting medium (the moss the orchid is planted in). If it’s very dry, give the plant a more thorough watering.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> ALWAYS water below the leaves. If water flows into and sits and the center of the leaves, it will lead to crown rot and kill the orchid. If water does get between the leaves, soak it up with cotton buds or tissue. You can also blow gently into the meeting of the leaves to remove this water. Notes &amp; Tips: Keep me warm! Orchids are very sensitive to changes in temperature. If your orchid is exposed to cold (under 55 degrees) for more than 10 minutes, the unbloomed buds will begin to “blast” – turn yellow and shrivel up, and eventually fall off the plant. There’s no reversing this once it’s happened. Consider sending fresh flowers or another plant during the winter months. </p>",
